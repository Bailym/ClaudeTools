# ClaudeTools

A personal collection of Claude Code agents, skills, and hooks — installable on any machine via the Claude Code plugin marketplace.

## Installation

### From inside Claude Code (`/plugin`)

**1. Add this repo as a marketplace:**
```
/plugin marketplace add bailym/ClaudeTools
```

**2. Install individual plugins** — either with the shorthand:
```
/plugin install code-reviewer@bailym-claude-tools
/plugin install tdd-auditor@bailym-claude-tools
```
…or browse interactively: run `/plugin`, open the **Discover** tab, pick a
plugin, and press Enter to choose an install scope (user / project / local).

**3. Activate them in the current session:**
```
/reload-plugins
```
Plugins are auto-enabled on install; `/reload-plugins` loads them without a
restart. Manage them anytime via `/plugin` (**Installed** / **Marketplaces**
tabs) or `/plugin list`.

> Skills from a plugin are namespaced — e.g. invoke the refactor skill as
> `/bailym-claude-tools:refactor`.

### From the shell (`claude` CLI)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add bailym/ClaudeTools
claude plugin install code-reviewer@bailym-claude-tools
claude plugin marketplace update bailym-claude-tools   # update to the latest versions
```
